# IDS-ML-MiniProject - Jupyter Notebooks

-   Each collaborator has to have their own jupyter notebook, with the naming convention `nb-[INITIALS].ipynb`. This is because it it difficult for git to create diffs for `.ipynb` files

-   Ensure that you DO NOT MODIFY the jupyter notebook of other collaborators

-   These notebooks can be used for prototyping, exploration and communicating findings
